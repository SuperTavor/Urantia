# Urantia
a tool that ports Yo-Kai Watch mods between regions.

Urantia means "Universe" in Theosophy. This was chosen because with this tool, even people who live in the us (basically another planet) can play ykw mods without pirating the eur version.

# Building
Install pyinstaller using pip: pip install pyinstaller/n
pyinstaller urantia.py --onefile
